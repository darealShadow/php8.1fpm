# php8.1fpm
This repository contains the details around building a container for PHP8.1 FPM. I use this container in my implementation within Kubernetes for a nextcloud instance and I document this journey on https://youtube.com/@IloveOpenSourceSoftware. The container build file is the sh script in this repository. Feel free to use and modify to your needs. Take a look at my channel on youtube to see how I used it.
